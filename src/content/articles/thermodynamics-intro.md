# Introduction to Thermodynamics

Thermodynamics is the branch of physics that deals with heat, work, and temperature, and their relation to energy, entropy, and the physical properties of matter and radiation.

## The Laws of Thermodynamics

### First Law

The first law of thermodynamics is essentially the conservation of energy principle. It states that energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transferred or converted from one form to another.

Mathematically, this can be expressed as:

$$
\begin{equation}
\Delta U = Q - W
\end{equation}
$$

Where:
- $\Delta U$ is the change in internal energy
- $Q$ is the heat added to the system
- $W$ is the work done by the system

### Second Law

The second law of thermodynamics states that the total entropy of an isolated system always increases over time.

The entropy change can be calculated as:

$$
\begin{equation}
\Delta S = \int \frac{dQ_{rev}}{T}
\end{equation}
$$

For an irreversible process:

$$\Delta S > \int \frac{dQ}{T}$$

### Example Calculation

Consider a heat engine operating between temperatures $T_h = 400K$ and $T_c = 300K$. The maximum efficiency is:

$$\eta_{max} = 1 - \frac{T_c}{T_h} = 1 - \frac{300K}{400K} = 1 - 0.75 = 0.25 = 25\%$$

## Conclusion

This is just a basic introduction to thermodynamics. In future posts, we'll explore more advanced concepts and applications.
